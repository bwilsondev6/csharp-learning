# C# Learning Projects

This repository contains my practice projects as I learn C# and .NET fundamentals.

## âœ… Project: Guessing Game
A simple console game where:
- The program picks a random number between 18 and 40.
- You have 5 attempts to guess the number.
- Gives hints (higher/lower).
- Validates input to prevent crashes.

### ðŸŽ® How to Run
```bash
dotnet run
```

### ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts Used
- Random number generation (`Random`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditional logic (`if/else`)
- Input validation (`int.TryParse`)
